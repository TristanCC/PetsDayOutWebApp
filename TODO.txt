Desired flow:

not logged in? route to log in page
logged in? route to home page with table of all customers

Home functionality:
 - Add Customer
 - Add/View/Edit Pets
 x Add/Edit/View Customer info
 - Search/filter Customer based on name or phone number (think about formatting)
 - Mark Customer present (how to track?)
 - Filter present customers tab

Login functionality:
 - User authentication
 - Error handling for incorrect credentials
 - Redirect to home page upon successful login

Potential improvements:
 - Add notifications for important events (e.g., new customer added)
 - Improve UI/UX for better user experience
 - Add unit and integration tests for critical components
 - Optimize performance for large datasets (pagination?)

Misc:
 - optionally link customers together to share pet pool
 - delete confirmation modal
 - on customer delete, check (likely using a join table) for linked customers, if so, don't delete pets



 NEW TODO:

 implement archival records for pets and customers
 fix deleting functionality (currently bugged wrt households)
 implement removing person from household.
